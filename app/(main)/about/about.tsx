          About Knowledge Chain
        </h1>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Knowledge Chain is a blockchain-powered platform designed to validate
          knowledge in a transparent, secure, and verifiable way. By combining
          NFTs, stablecoin payments, and identity verification, we ensure that
          every participant is uniquely identified and fairly assessed.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Users begin by minting a Knowledge NFT on the Polygon network using USDC.
          This NFT represents verified participation and unlocks access to
          knowledge-based tests and assessments.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-12">
          After minting, users verify their identity via email authentication.
          Once verified, they gain access to exclusive tests that measure real
          understanding — not just participation.
        </p>

              To create a trusted system where knowledge, learning, and
              participation can be verified on-chain without manipulation.

            <p className="text-gray-200">
              Blockchain ensures transparency, immutability, and fairness.
              NFTs prevent duplicate participation while Polygon keeps costs low
              and transactions fast.
